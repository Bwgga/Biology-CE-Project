\begin{abstract}
    This paper explores the experimental simulation of electric eel cells. By simulating the electrochemical 
	conditions found within eel electrocytes on a macroscopic scale, this experiment was able to produce 
	significant voltages ranging in the hundreds of millivolts. Specifically, this experiment employed 
	the use of sodium alginate, an organic salt that releases Na+ ions in water, to simulate the release of sodium 
	ions in electrocytes. By using dialysis tubing with a specific pore size, it was possible to trap the alginate 
	while allowing the diffusion of Na+, thereby creating a charge differential across the tubing and inducing a measurable
	voltage.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Native to the freshwater rivers of South America, the \textit{Electrophorus electricus}, or more 
commonly referred to as the electric eel, is known for its ability to generate high voltage shocks,
formally known as electric organ discharges (EOD); these EODs can be classified into low-voltage 
EODs and high-voltage EODs. Low-voltage EODs are expressed at lower frequencies of about 10Hz to
20Hz \parencite{cataniaAstonishingBehaviorElectric2019}, reaching about 10 V \parencite{ElectricCircuits6ElectricEels2015}. 
Therefore, they are more practical for communication and determining the presence of organisms 
in their environment through a process called electrolocation: monitoring 
changes in a particular electric field \parencite{bennettComparativePhysiologyElectric1970}. 
On the other hand, high-voltage EODs are used as an attack or defence mechanism,
the largest recorded voltage discharge being 500V \parencite{ElectricCircuits6ElectricEels2015}.
However, whether the emitted EODs are expressed as low or high 
voltages, they are produced from a specific cell that makes up 80\% of the eel’s body: electrocytes
\parencite{carlsonAnimalBehaviorElectric2015}. These electrocyte cells are arranged in series and 
in parallel and are located in the electric eel’s three most prominent organs: Sach’s organ, the 
Main organ, and Hunter’s organ \parencite{ElectricCircuits6ElectricEels2015}. [cite this figure (Figure 1.)] This 
arrangement allows for the entire eel to be viewed as a battery, with the positive and negative 
poles at the head and tail respectively, allowing for the variety of EOD voltages mentioned above. 
Although electric eels have the potential to release high-voltage EODs, the current produced remains
nonetheless quite minimal (~1 A) \parencite{ElectricCircuits6ElectricEels2015}. This is a result 
of the high resistance of the freshwater where these eels are found, or more precisely, the lack of 
ions to maintain the electric current \parencite{boisseletBiomimeticPotentialElectric2017}. 
Consequently, to optimize the battery potential of the electric eels EOD, research was conducted 
by Lina Guezi \parencite{gueziTheoreticalExaminationConception2023}, a collegue of ours, to produce 
a synthetic replication of the electric eel’s electrocyte 
cells in ionized water. Our experiment aims to test their research findings by making our own battery prototype based off of their work with a few modifications in order to explore 
the potential uses of this biological battery. To do so we used a dialysis membrane to isolate positive sodium ions ( $Na^+$), similarly to how the electric eels do in their
electrocyte cells, which creates a potential gradient across our synthetic electrocyte cell.
This process generates a voltage difference which then produces an electric discharge, 
similarly to a battery. The synthetic batteries created in this lab function through the
principles of diffusion and dissociation.

Firstly, the salt used in this experiment is sodium 
alginate. Like all salts, sodium alginate is composed of a positively-charged cation (in this case, sodium),
and a negatively-charged anion (here, alginic acid). These two components are fused together in solid 
form by an ionic bond. However, when placed in an aqueous environment, the ionic bond is broken and 
the two components are allowed to separate. This phenomenon occurs in most salts, and is known as 
dissociation. Next, this experiment uses diffusion and a semi-permeable membrane to separate the charged 
ions. The sodium alginate is held in a capsule made of dialysis tubing, a specialized membrane with 
microscopic pores. These pores are of a very particular size, as to allow certain smaller molecules to 
pass freely across the membrane, while blocking larger molecules from crossing. This is known as a 
semi-permeable membrane. The membrane used in this experiment has a molecular cut-off weight between 
6,000 and 8,000 Daltons. This means that 90\% of molecules with a molecular weight greater than 8,000 
Daltons will be trapped by the membrane \parencite{MolecularWeightCut2014}. In the case of alginic acid, 
which possesses a molecular weight between 10,000 and 600,000 Daltons 
\parencite{MolecularWeightDetermination}, the membrane is non-permeable. This means that the alginic 
acid ions placed within the tubing will remain. However, the sodium ions released are quite small, with 
a mass of around 23 Daltons. Therefore, they are free to diffuse across the membrane into the surrounding 
water. Taking into account the fact that sodium ions possess a charge of 1+, and the alginic acid, 
therefore, possesses a charge of 1-, as sodium ions begin to diffuse across the membrane, the water 
outside the tubing acquires a positive charge. Likewise, the solution within the tubing starts to 
contain more alginic acid than sodium and therefore goes from a neutral solution to becoming 
negatively charged. This charge imbalance is then measurable by using a voltmeter.


\section{Material and Methods}
\label{sec:matandmet}

\subsection*{Materials}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Drinking glasses or other receptacles capable of holding water
	\item Dialysis tubing with a MWCO of 6-8kDa
	\item Sodium alginate powder
	\item Voltmeter
	\item Alligator wires
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Method}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Drinking glasses were rinsed and filled with hot tap water. Roughly 10cm pieces of dialysis tubing were cut, and one piece of tubing was soaked in each glass for 30 minutes.
	\item Dialysis tubing pieces were removed from the water, opened up, and a knot was tied at the bottom of each piece, sealing it. 1.25mL of sodium alginate powder was inserted into each section of tubing, and the tubes were filled around 3/4 of the way with water to dissolve the powder. Stirring rods were used to aid soaking and dissolution of the powder.
	\item The filled dialysis membranes were placed back into their glasses, open side up, ensuring that the top of each piece protruded past the water level in the glasses.
	\item The setup was left for 12 hours to maximize ionic diffusion.
	\item The voltage of each sample was measured by placing two alligator-clip wires in each glass: one wire was placed inside the dialysis tubing, and one was placed in the glass but outside the tubing. The positive probe of the voltmeter was then attached to the wire outside the tubing, and the negative probe was connected to the wire inside the tubing. A reading was then made using the voltmeter and the data was recorded. This was repeated for each replicate.

The results obtained by the lab indicate that the voltages produced by the experimental 
replicates (M=81.82mV, SD=20) are significantly greater than those generated by the control 
group t(4) = -2.6, p = .048. This confirms the hypothesis that if sodium alginate is 
dissociated inside a dialysis membrane, by diffusion, a potential difference will be 
created between the inside and outside of the membrane.

Our experiment created a voltage using a reaction similar to an electrolyte in an 
electric eel. By releasing sodium alginate, an ionic molecule that dissociates into 
two oppositely charged particles of different sizes, we were able to separate the 
sodium cations from the alginate anions, thus creating a difference in charge inside 
and outside the membrane. This created a difference of potential and voltage. The initial 
voltage measured was significantly higher than the control (38mV, 600mV, and 40.9mV). 
After 12 hours, the voltage was also higher than the control (101.26,141,39mV, 46mV, and 26.4 mV). 
The p-value after 12 hours was 0.048 which means our results are significant because 
it is less than 0.1, which is the standard for battery making\parencite{niriQuantifyingKeyFactors2022}. 
Additionally, our data suggests that the voltage after 12 hours is lower than that measured immediately after the dissolution of the sodium alginate. This voltage drop may be due to the dialysis membrane pore size. If the pores are too large, it may be possible for small quantities of alginic acid to slowly diffuse across the membrane. We also observed that adding aluminum foil to the end of the electrode of the voltmeter seems to significantly increase the voltage. Unfortunately, as we were limited by the quantity of materials, we did not do replicates of this. Having 2.5mL of sodium alginate also does not seem to affect the voltage measured, though this result is not conclusive.

We noticed that the current is very low and decreases rapidly. When measured, 
the voltage would drop significantly during the time it was being measured. This is 
similar to the voltage produced by electric eels which can produce high voltages but 
for a very short time. Even when the voltage was semi-stable, it fluctuated greatly. 
Our results are around 5-10 mV away from the true voltage because it varied so much. 
 tried to read a voltage in the middle. 

To further explore the potential of these batteries, it would be useful to make more 
replicates. Due to our lack of membrane, we were limited to seven attempts. By experimenting 
with different procedures, we refined our protocol to give the best results. If we were to 
redo this experiment, we would put only 1.25 mL of powder in as 2.5 mL does not fit easily, 
is hard to mix, and overflowed. We would also put aluminum foil on the electrodes to increase 
the surface area to which ions can attach to generate a higher voltage. We would also use a 
membrane of the appropriate pore size to restrict the flow of alginate and only let sodium pass 
through the membrane. We would also measure the voltage more frequently to find the time at which 
the most sodium diffused but with the least amount of alginic acid diffused. If we make a graph 
showing the progression of voltage over time, we will be able to maximize the voltage. It would 
also be interesting to put multiple cells in series to generate an even higher voltage. This would 
be harder because all electrodes would have to be put in simultaneously as the current decreases 
so rapidly. 

Our battery functions similarly to a capacitor which can output high voltages 
in a short period of time. Its uses would be similar to that of capacitors as well.
