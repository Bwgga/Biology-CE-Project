\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Native to the freshwater rivers of South America, the \textit{Electrophorus electricus}, or more 
commonly referred to as the electric eel, is known for its ability to generate high voltage shocks,
formally known as electric organ discharges (EOD); these EODs can be classified into low-voltage 
EODs and high-voltage EODs. Low-voltage EODs are expressed at lower frequencies of about 10Hz to
20Hz \parencite{cataniaAstonishingBehaviorElectric2019}, reaching about 10 V \parencite{ElectricCircuits6ElectricEels2015}. 
Therefore, they are more practical for communication and determining the presence of organisms 
in their environment through a process called electrolocation: monitoring 
changes in a particular electric field \parencite{bennettComparativePhysiologyElectric1970}. 
On the other hand, high-voltage EODs are used as an attack or defence mechanism,
the largest recorded voltage discharge being 500V \parencite{ElectricCircuits6ElectricEels2015}.
However, whether the emitted EODs are expressed as low or high 
voltages, they are produced from a specific cell that makes up 80\% of the eel’s body: electrocytes
\parencite{carlsonAnimalBehaviorElectric2015}. These electrocyte cells are arranged in series and 
in parallel and are located in the electric eel’s three most prominent organs: Sach’s organ, the 
Main organ, and Hunter’s organ \parencite{ElectricCircuits6ElectricEels2015}. [cite this figure (Figure 1.)] This 
arrangement allows for the entire eel to be viewed as a battery, with the positive and negative 
poles at the head and tail respectively, allowing for the variety of EOD voltages mentioned above. 
Although electric eels have the potential to release high-voltage EODs, the current produced remains
nonetheless quite minimal (~1 A) \parencite{ElectricCircuits6ElectricEels2015}. This is a result 
of the high resistance of the freshwater where these eels are found, or more precisely, the lack of 
ions to maintain the electric current \parencite{boisseletBiomimeticPotentialElectric2017}. 
Consequently, to optimize the battery potential of the electric eels EOD, research was conducted 
by Lina Guezi \parencite{gueziTheoreticalExaminationConception2023}, a collegue of ours, to produce 
a synthetic replication of the electric eel’s electrocyte 
cells in ionized water. Our experiment aims to test their research findings by making our own battery prototype based off of their work with a few modifications in order to explore 
the potential uses of this biological battery. To do so we used a dialysis membrane to isolate positive sodium ions ( $Na^+$), similarly to how the electric eels do in their
electrocyte cells, which creates a potential gradient across our synthetic electrocyte cell. This process generates a voltage difference 
which then produces an electric discharge.
