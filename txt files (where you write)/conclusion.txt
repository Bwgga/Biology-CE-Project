To conclude, our experiment created a voltage using a similar reaction to that of an electrolyte in an electric eel. By releasing sodium alginate, an ionic molecules that dissociate into two oppositely charged particles of different sizes, we were able to separate the positively charged Na from the rest of the molecule, thus creating a difference in charge inside and outside the membrane. This created a difference of potential and thus a voltage. The initial voltage measured was significantly higher than the control (38mV, 600mV, and 40.9mV). After 12 hours, the voltage was also higher than the control (101.26,141,39mV, 46mV, and 26.4 mV). Our data suggests that the voltage after 12 hours is lower than the initial one which would disprove our hypothesis that letting the sodium ions diffuse during 12 hours would increase the voltage. This could possibly be due to the lack of an appropriate membrane. We also observed that adding aluminum foil to the end of the electrode of the voltmeter increases the voltage (600mV initially compared to 38mV initially), though our results are inconclusive. 

To further explore the potential of these batteries, it would be useful to make more replicates. Due to our lack of membrane, we were limited to 7 replicates. Through our various experimenting, we refined our protocol to give the best results. If we were to redo this experiment, we would put only 1.25 mL of powder in as 2.5 mL does not fit easily, is hard to mix, and overflowed. We would also put aluminum foil on the electrodes to increase the surface area to which ions can attach to. We would also use a membrane of the appropriate pore size to restrict the flow of alginate and only let sodium pass through the membrane. We would also measure the voltage more frequently to find the time at which the most sodium diffused but the least amount of alginate diffused as well.
