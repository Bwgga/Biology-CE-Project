Draft Abstract:

This paper explores the experimental replication of electric eel cells. By simulating the electrochemical conditions found within eel electrocytes on a macroscopic scale, this experiment was able to produce significant voltages ranging in the hundreds of millivolts. Specifically, this experiment employed the use of sodium alginate, an organic salt that releases Na+ ions in water, to simulate the release of sodium ions in electrocytes. By using dialysis tubing with a specific pore size, it was possible to trap the alginate while allowing the diffusion of Na+, thereby creating a charge differential across the tubing and inducing a voltage.
