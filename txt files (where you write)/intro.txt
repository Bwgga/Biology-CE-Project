Their intro:
 The electric eel (Electrophorus electricus) is a type of fish living in slow-moving
 freshwater creeks and swamps in the northeastern regions of South America (The University of
 Western Australia, 2010). They are known for their ability to fire high-voltage discharges for
 defense and offense. 80% of their elongated body is composed of three pairs of electric organs
 (EO), and they contain many modified muscle cells called electrocytes or electroplax, which are
 the cells responsible for generating the electrical discharges (Gotter et al. 2012).
 Only one side of the membrane of an electrocyte, usually relatively flat, is innervated
 with electromotor neurons and contains voltage gated Na+ channels (see Figure 1). The other side
 of the membrane is more undulated and does not respond to nerve signals. Signals sent to an
 electrocyte arrive at the innervated membrane and activate the Na+ channels, causing positively
 charged sodium ions to flood into the cell. This flow of ions creates a temporary ion
 concentration gradient that generates a potential difference across the two ends of an electrocyte.
 This voltage produced from one cell is very small, averaging around 150 mV, but with
 many electrocytes (shaped like flattened disks) stacked together in series, a combined discharge
 can range up to 700V (Gotter et al. 858).
 It seems reasonable to then ask whether a biological battery can be built using the same
 method—if artificial synthetic cells can be built to recreate electrocytes and use ion
 concentration gradients to carry voltage as effectively as natural eel electrocytes. This
 comparison can have two outcomes: if synthetic electrocytes are used to create a biological
 battery, then its voltage will differ from a biological battery made with electrocytes from
 Electrophorus electricus; or the voltage will not differ.
 Electric eels live in freshwater, where the conductivity is not maximized. Thus, exploring
 saltwater environments within our battery could potentially optimize the current in the latter.
 To determine this, electrodes are attached to ion-conductive membranes to create
 synthetic electrocytes, which are then connected together to form a battery to store voltage.
 For it to be a fully biological battery, it is powered by a voltage generated from (Corpuscularia
 lehmannii), studied by Davi Gava Bittencourt, Mohammad Jibran Budullah, Youssef Missoum,
 and Alhasan Shnoot, converting electricity from solar energy. The connected synthetic
 electrocytes are immersed in freshwater and in saltwater as well in separate groups, so to test if
 putting the cells in saltwater will optimize the battery. The resulting voltage across the electrodes
 is measured by a voltmeter, and the results can be compared.

draft intro:
Native to the freshwater rivers of South America, the \textit{Electrophorus electricus}, or more commonly referred to as the electric eel, is
known for its ability to generate high voltage shocks, formally known as electric organ discharges (EOD); these EODs can be classified into low-voltage EODs and high-voltage 
EODs. Low-voltage EODs are expressed at lower frequencies of about 10Hz to 20Hz, reaching about 10 V [\cite this paper (K.C Catania, 2019)] [\cite the u aus pdf]. 
Therefore, they are more practical for communication and determining the presence of organisms in their environment through a process called electrolocation: monitoring 
changes in a particular electric field [\cite this paper (Bennett,1970)]. On the other hand, high-voltage EODs are used as an attack or defence mechanism,
the largest recorded voltage discharge being 500V [\cite the u aus pdf].
However, whether the emitted EODs are expressed as low or high 
voltages, they are produced from a specific cell that makes up 80% of the eel’s body: electrocytes. [\cite this paper (University of Western 
Australia, 2015)].These electrocyte cells are arranged in series and in parallel and are located in the electric eel’s three most prominent organs: Sach’s 
organ, the Main organ, and Hunter’s organ [\cite u aus pdf]. [\cite this figure (Figure 1.)] This arrangement allows for the entire eel to be viewed as a battery, with the 
positive and negative poles at the head and tail respectively, allowing for the variety of EOD voltages mentioned above. Although 
electric eels have the potential to release high-voltage EODs, the current produced remains nonetheless quite minimal (~1 A) [\cite u aus pdf]. This is a result 
of the high resistance of the freshwater where these eels are found, or more precisely, the lack of ions to maintain the electric 
current. [\cite this paper (Biomimetic potential of electric eels, Kommentare, 2017)]. Consequently, to optimize the battery potential of the electric eels 
EOD, research was conducted by Lina Guezi [\cite this paper (Guezi, Lina et al.)], a collegue of ours, to produce a synthetic replication of the electric eel’s electrocyte 
cells in ionized water. Our experiment aims to test their research findings by making our own battery prototype based off of their work with a few modifications in order to explore 
the potential uses of this biological battery. To do so we used a dialysis membrane to isolate positive sodium ions (Na^+), similarly to how the electric eels do in their
electrocyte cells, which creates a potential gradient across our synthetic electrocyte cell. This process generates a voltage difference 
which then produces an electric discharge. [Jocob please conplete details of how our b=prototypes work]
