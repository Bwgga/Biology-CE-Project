Native to the freshwater rivers of South America, the \textit{Electrophorus electricus}, or more commonly referred to as the electric eel, is
known for its ability to generate high voltage shocks, formally known as electric organ discharges (EOD); these EODs can be classified into low-voltage EODs and high-voltage 
EODs. Low-voltage EODs are expressed at lower frequencies of about 10Hz to 20Hz, reaching about 10 V [\cite this paper (K.C Catania, 2019)] [\cite the u aus pdf]. 
Therefore, they are more practical for communication and determining the presence of organisms in their environment through a process called electrolocation: monitoring 
changes in a particular electric field [\cite this paper (Bennett,1970)]. On the other hand, high-voltage EODs are used as an attack or defence mechanism,
the largest recorded voltage discharge being 500V [\cite the u aus pdf].
However, whether the emitted EODs are expressed as low or high 
voltages, they are produced from a specific cell that makes up 80% of the eel’s body: electrocytes. [\cite this paper (University of Western 
Australia, 2015)].These electrocyte cells are arranged in series and in parallel and are located in the electric eel’s three most prominent organs: Sach’s 
organ, the Main organ, and Hunter’s organ [\cite u aus pdf]. [\cite this figure (Figure 1.)] This arrangement allows for the entire eel to be viewed as a battery, with the 
positive and negative poles at the head and tail respectively, allowing for the variety of EOD voltages mentioned above. Although 
electric eels have the potential to release high-voltage EODs, the current produced remains nonetheless quite minimal (~1 A) [\cite u aus pdf]. This is a result 
of the high resistance of the freshwater where these eels are found, or more precisely, the lack of ions to maintain the electric 
current. [\cite this paper (Biomimetic potential of electric eels, Kommentare, 2017)]. Consequently, to optimize the battery potential of the electric eels 
EOD, research was conducted by Lina Guezi [\cite this paper (Guezi, Lina et al.)], a collegue of ours, to produce a synthetic replication of the electric eel’s electrocyte 
cells in ionized water. Our experiment aims to test their research findings by making our own battery prototype based off of their work with a few modifications in order to explore 
the potential uses of this biological battery. To do so we used a dialysis membrane to isolate positive sodium ions (Na^+), similarly to how the electric eels do in their
electrocyte cells, which creates a potential gradient across our synthetic electrocyte cell. This process generates a voltage difference 
which then produces an electric discharge. [Jocob please conplete details of how our b=prototypes work]
