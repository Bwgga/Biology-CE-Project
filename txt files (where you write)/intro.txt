Their intro:
 The electric eel (Electrophorus electricus) is a type of fish living in slow-moving
 freshwater creeks and swamps in the northeastern regions of South America (The University of
 Western Australia, 2010). They are known for their ability to fire high-voltage discharges for
 defense and offense. 80% of their elongated body is composed of three pairs of electric organs
 (EO), and they contain many modified muscle cells called electrocytes or electroplax, which are
 the cells responsible for generating the electrical discharges (Gotter et al. 2012).
 Only one side of the membrane of an electrocyte, usually relatively flat, is innervated
 with electromotor neurons and contains voltage gated Na+ channels (see Figure 1). The other side
 of the membrane is more undulated and does not respond to nerve signals. Signals sent to an
 electrocyte arrive at the innervated membrane and activate the Na+ channels, causing positively
 charged sodium ions to flood into the cell. This flow of ions creates a temporary ion
 concentration gradient that generates a potential difference across the two ends of an electrocyte.
 This voltage produced from one cell is very small, averaging around 150 mV, but with
 many electrocytes (shaped like flattened disks) stacked together in series, a combined discharge
 can range up to 700V (Gotter et al. 858).
 It seems reasonable to then ask whether a biological battery can be built using the same
 methodâ€”if artificial synthetic cells can be built to recreate electrocytes and use ion
 concentration gradients to carry voltage as effectively as natural eel electrocytes. This
 comparison can have two outcomes: if synthetic electrocytes are used to create a biological
 battery, then its voltage will differ from a biological battery made with electrocytes from
 Electrophorus electricus; or the voltage will not differ.
 Electric eels live in freshwater, where the conductivity is not maximized. Thus, exploring
 saltwater environments within our battery could potentially optimize the current in the latter.
 To determine this, electrodes are attached to ion-conductive membranes to create
 synthetic electrocytes, which are then connected together to form a battery to store voltage.
 For it to be a fully biological battery, it is powered by a voltage generated from (Corpuscularia
 lehmannii), studied by Davi Gava Bittencourt, Mohammad Jibran Budullah, Youssef Missoum,
 and Alhasan Shnoot, converting electricity from solar energy. The connected synthetic
 electrocytes are immersed in freshwater and in saltwater as well in separate groups, so to test if
 putting the cells in saltwater will optimize the battery. The resulting voltage across the electrodes
 is measured by a voltmeter, and the results can be compared.

draft intro:
Native to the rivers of South America, the *Electrophorus electricus*, more commonly known as the electric eel, releases high voltage currents through electrocyte cells, which allows it to generate a relatively large amount of electricity. The purpose of this experiment is to simulate the electrocytes of the electric eel in order to explore potential uses of this naturally occurring biological battery
