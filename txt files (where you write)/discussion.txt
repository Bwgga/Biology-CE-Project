The batteries created in this lab function through the principles of diffusion and dissociation. Firstly, the salt used in this experiment is sodium alginate. Like all salts, sodium alginate is composed of a positively-charged cation (in this case, sodium), and a negatively-charged anion (here, alginate). These two components are fused together in solid form by an ionic bond. However, when placed in an aqueous environment, the ionic bond is broken and the two components are allowed to separate. This phenomenon occurs in most salts, and is known as dissociation. 

Next, this experiment uses diffusion and a semi-permeable membrane to separate the charged ions. The sodium alginate is held in a capsule made of dialysis tubing, a specialized membrane with microscopic pores. These pores are of a very particular size, as to allow certain smaller molecules to pass freely across the membrane, while blocking larger molecules from crossing. This is known as a semi-permeable membrane. The membrane used in this experiment has a molecular cut-off weight between 6,000 and 8,000 Daltons. This means that 90% of molecules with a molecular weight greater than 8,000 Da will be trapped by the membrane (source 2).
